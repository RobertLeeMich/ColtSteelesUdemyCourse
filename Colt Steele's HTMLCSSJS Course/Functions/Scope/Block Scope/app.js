//"block" refers to curly braces used in code. If vars are declared within curly braces anywhere, it's only scoped in block code

//if you use "var" for variable declaration though, it will be scoped outside of the curly braces. GENERALLY YOU DON'T EVER USE VAR ANYMORE

//let and const are for following block-ed scoping rules, generally.
